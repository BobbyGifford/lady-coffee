    <Info>
      We care about social values, including housing, education, child labor,
      health care, worker safety, and womenâ€™s issues, among many others. We
      insist suppliers we buy from care about these issues too. We require that
      every partner throughout our supply chain has at least one substantive
      social program in place. This criteria allows us to choose and,
      ultimately, favor partners that actively share our values.
